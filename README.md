# Teleport
## Tell me where, we will take you there! ==> https://teleport-world-clock.herokuapp.com/

### What
Teleport is a cool app which shows you a city's current time and weather information.

### How
1. User chooses a city from drop-down menu
2. Event listener triggered for the input
3. XHR/server Request --> API calls
4. Get response from API calls and output provided
5. Dom Manipulation / filtering of data
6. Rendering of information back to user graphically


### Why
This project is to apply what we have learned, especially how to :
 - Make your API calls from the back-end using the Request module
 - Back-end testing using tape and basic front-end testing
 - Hosting project on heroku
 - Testing server by injecting fake HTTP requests using Shot
 - Using module.exports and require to break a single large server file into smaller modules
 - Employing continuous integration on your project with Travis
